1. Prerequisites:

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or later)
npm (comes with Node.js)
MetaMask Extension (for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain)
Hardhat (for local blockchain development)


2. Project Setup:
Clone the Project: If you havenâ€™t already cloned the project, do so with the following command:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/etherweave.git
cd etherweave
Install Dependencies: In the project root, run the following command to install all the required Node.js dependencies:


npm install


3. Set Up Environment Variables:
Create .env File: Create a .env file in the project root with the following content:


REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS={your_contract_address}
REACT_APP_CHAIN_ID=31337

Ethereum Network Configuration:

Ensure you are using the correct contract address and chain ID.
By default, the chainId is set to 31337 for local Hardhat testing.


4. Running the Local Blockchain:

Start Hardhat Network: In the project directory, open a terminal and run the following command to start the local blockchain:


npx hardhat node

Deploy Contracts: In another terminal, deploy the smart contracts to the local Hardhat network:


npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost


5. MetaMask Configuration:
