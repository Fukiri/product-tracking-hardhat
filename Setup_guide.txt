Setup Guide for EtherWeave

1. Prerequisites:

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or later)
npm (comes with Node.js)
MetaMask Extension (for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain)
Hardhat (for local blockchain development)


2. Project Setup:
Clone the Project: If you havenâ€™t already cloned the project, do so with the following command:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/etherweave.git
cd etherweave
Install Dependencies: In the project root, run the following command to install all the required Node.js dependencies:


npm install


3. Set Up Environment Variables:
Create .env File: Create a .env file in the project root with the following content:


REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS={your_contract_address}
REACT_APP_CHAIN_ID=31337

Ethereum Network Configuration:

Ensure you are using the correct contract address and chain ID.
By default, the chainId is set to 31337 for local Hardhat testing.


4. Running the Local Blockchain:

Start Hardhat Network: In the project directory, open a terminal and run the following command to start the local blockchain:


npx hardhat node

Deploy Contracts: In another terminal, deploy the smart contracts to the local Hardhat network:


npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost


5. MetaMask Configuration:

Connect MetaMask to Local Network:
Open MetaMask and connect to the local Hardhat network.

Use the following settings in MetaMask:
Network Name: Localhost 8545
RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545
Chain ID: 31337

Import test accounts using the private keys provided by Hardhat when you run npx hardhat node.

8. Running the Database:

Install PostgreSQL: Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed from the official site.

Configure the Database:

Navigate to the product-tracking-hardhat/product-tracking-database directory.
Open a terminal and create the necessary tables and mock data by running:

psql -U postgres -f setup_database.sql

Enter the PostgreSQL password you have configured during installation when prompted.


Configure Express Server:

Open the index.js file located in the product-tracking-hardhat/product-tracking-database directory.
Replace the placeholder on line 17 with your PostgreSQL password to connect to the database.
Start the Express Server:

In the same directory, run the following command to start the backend server:
bash
Copy code
node index.js
The server will now listen at http://localhost:5000 and connect to the PostgreSQL database for backend operations.

See database_setup README.md file for detailed setup guide

7. Running the Frontend:

Start the Frontend Application: To run the frontend in development mode, use the following command:


npm start

Access the Application: Open your browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:3000
